## what is this lab used for ?
I created this repository while I was finishing labs for class ICS. It's basically a record of my learning experience.
## how can I use it ?
Every branch of this repository is a seperate lab, and I have included my own answer there. You can fork anyone of them to get started.
## can I fork these labs for other use ?
All these labs for class assignments from [__PKU__](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), make sure you have contacted related parties for admissions before you do anything.
## some words to say
_feel free to use it for your study and have fun_\^_^
