## Triky points
* It is highly possible that you will struggle in PARTB to get full mark. That's what I have experienced and why I want's to leave these points here. <br/><br/>

* The first thing you will need is blocking, choose an appropriate block size in different case.<br/><br/>

* The second tip is you can move all the elements in a block to the destination matrix brfore transposing, then transpose them in the destination matrix. This will avoid collision between retrieving element from the source and save it in destination.<br/><br/>

* The third tip is that your visit sequence really counts. Think about how to move blocks with less cache misses.<br/><br/>

* I have referred to [this blog](https://arthals.ink/posts/experience/cache-lab) while finishing this lab. It helped me a lot when solving 60x68 matrix.
