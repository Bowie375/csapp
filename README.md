# Data Lab
---
## Files
* __bits-answer.c__ : 
  my answer code. It runs smoothly and passes all the test. <br/><br/>
* __datalab-handout.tar__ : 
  the original handout tarball. It's completely new,   you can untar this file and start building your code from the beginning.<br/><br/>
* __datalab.pdf__ : 
  the guidance file. It specifies what you should do and how.<br/><br/>
* __README.md__ : this file.

## Tricky Points
* __bisect__ is what you need if you run into problems.<br/><br/>
* I have referred to this blog while finishing this lab : [Cameudis's Blog](https://www.cameudis.com/Tech/CSAPP/1b2c81a4ea2a.html)

## Some words to say
* First, this whole Project comes from [_PKU_](https://www.pku.edu.cn), be sure to contact the relavent party if you need to fork this repository.<br/><br/>
* Second, the only purpose I created this repository is to markdown my progress in finishing these labs. But I'll be happy if you can get some useful ideas from my works here.<br/><br/>
* Just a reminder, maybe you will think of making such a repository while you are doing your works too, if you don't want to see ALL your works GONE silently just after having a sound sleep. Trust me \^_^ .
