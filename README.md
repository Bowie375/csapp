## some word to say
* My opinion of this lab: 
It's possibly the most difficult one of the first four labs. It's strenuous and tricky to achive full marks, even high marks will rack your brain, actually.
But anyway, it belongs to ICS, so I won't suggest you to cherish much hope for breezing through the lab during your lunch.
* I have writen a README for each part of the lab to offer some guidance. You will find them in your working directory while you walk through each section.
* MAKE SURE you have read __archlab.pdf__ for at least once before starting coding.
* I have to claim something here: there are lots of incredibly unbelievable answer programs on github, and on the web. Most of them behave much much better than what I provided here, which is 7.47/7.5 for PartC. If you have problem figuring it out but mine answer just won't satisfy your appetite, make the best of your searching tools.\^_^
* Again, _enjoy yourself and have fun_
