## Files
* _tshlab-answer.tar_ :
  mine code for this lab.<br/><br/>
* _tshlab-handout.tar_ :
  the original handout tarball, if you feel like doing this lab, you need to work on this tarball.<br/><br/>
* _tshlab.pdf_ :
  guidance file. I earnest recommand reading it through before coding.

## Tricky points
* you may be stuck in trace31.txt, this is because trace31.txt don't and __'\n'__ in the lastline !

  Try to avoid it? You can modify trace31.txt itself, of course, but you can also try to do something with _main_ function. See how _builtin_ attribute of each command line are determined will help you.<br/><br/>

* Make sure you know how to use _waitpid_.

### some words to say
This lab is completely a coding exercise. And as you can expect, the most strenuous part of finishing this lab is debugging your block of code.

If you finish this lab, you will have a much better understanding of how shell works, how signals effects and controls the behavior of your processes, and what the hell does job attribute means. And of course, you will learn to mediate your temper to avoid crushing your computer too.

_feel free to use it for your study and have fun!_
