# tiny web server
---
### introduction
This is a web server I built exactly according to the instruction on the book [CSAPP](https://hansimov.gitbook.io/csapp/). All the methods are the same as those on the book. It can run smoothly on my virtual machine.
### warning
It can only be used on Linux.
### some words to say
_feel free to use it for your study and have fun!_
