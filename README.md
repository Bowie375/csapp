# Tiny Web Server
---
## Introduction
This is a web server I built exactly according to the instruction on the book [CSAPP](https://hansimov.gitbook.io/csapp/). All the methods are the same as those on the book. It can run smoothly on my virtual machine.<br/><br/>

This program should run on Linux. <br/><br/>

  NOTE : This branch is not part of the labs, it's just my own interest.

## some words to say
_feel free to use it for your study and have fun!_
